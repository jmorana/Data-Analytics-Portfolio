# Customer Retention & Revenue Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

## 
This project analyzes 5 years of fictional customer and revenue data to uncover trends in churn, retention, customer lifetime value, and monthly recurring revenue (MRR). I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize patterns and forecast future revenue.

## Tools Used
- Power BI  
- DAX  
- Excel  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data modeling  
- DAX calculations  
- KPI dashboard design  
- Cohort analysis  
- Trend forecasting  

## Key Insights
- Annual churn rate: **12.8%**  
- High-value customers had **40% higher retention**  
- Seasonal acquisition peaks in Q2 & Q4  
- Forecasting model achieved **94% accuracy**  

## DAX Measures
```DAX
Churn Rate = DIVIDE([Lost Customers], [Starting Customers])

MRR = SUM(Revenue[Amount])

CLV = AVERAGE(Customer[LifetimeValue])
